# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations. The preview occasionally fails to render correctly, displaying a blank screen or a distorted image. The problem's intermittent nature makes debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The Expo Camera preview intermittently fails to render properly when using specific camera configurations.  The failure is not consistent and may occur after an initial successful render, after a change in camera mode or resolution, or seemingly at random.  The preview may show a blank screen, a distorted image, or a partially rendered view.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar environment.
4. Observe the camera preview.  The issue may manifest immediately or after some time.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the camera configuration is correctly set and applied.  Specifically, thoroughly verify the resolution settings are valid and compatible with the device and the camera's capabilities. Avoid using deprecated or poorly-supported options.
